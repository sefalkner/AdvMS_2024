For the latter, we here use simple overdamped langevin dynamics with the intend of making the implementation easy to read. The integrator is already implemented, nevertheless, we will dicuss it in a second. All implementations are heavily based on numpy and we use Numba to just-in-time compile the functions for an increase in performance.
