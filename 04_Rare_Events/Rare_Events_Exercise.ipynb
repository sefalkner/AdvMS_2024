    "The goal of this exercise is a first approach to rate calculation for rare events. Rare events are processes that happen rarely, but when they happen their dynamics is fast, in comparison to the molecular motion. This is a challenge for the numerical simulations, as a high resolution is needed for resolving the event but most of the computational time is spent in simulating non-interesting portion of the configuration/phase space.\n",

    "In this notebook we discuss two approaches: \n",
    "\n",
    "We first aim to calculate the correlation function $c_{AB}(t)$ from which we can estimate the rate based on data from a long MD simulation. For higher barriers and more complex systems this is usually not feasible and one would perform transition path sampling to obtain $c_{AB}(t)$ (we'll have a look at that in the next exercise).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then proceed to estimate the rate using an approximation based on transition state theory. Here we estimate the rate based on the volume of a state, the probability to be at the barrier top and the velocities at the barrier top."
